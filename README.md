# Referral Smart Contract

## Overview ðŸš€

The Referral Smart Contract is a decentralized referral system built on Lisk. It allows users to register with a referrer, earn rewards for referrals, and progress through levels based on their referral activity. The contract ensures fairness, enforces limits on referrals, and provides a seamless process for managing earnings and leveling up.
